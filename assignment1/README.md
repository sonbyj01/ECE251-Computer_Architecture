# Assignment 1
[Documentation](ECE251_Assignment1.pdf)

For this assignment, the two tasks were to (1) have two inputs, one that disables the counter and
another that forced the counter to count by 2, and (2) implement a subroutine that provides a
delay, in milliseconds, equal to the number contained in the W register when the subroutine is
called. This assignment was completed using the Debugger as the simulator on MPLABxIDE. The
chip that was simulated was the PIC 16F877A.
